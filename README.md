Prediction Analysis
  
Overview
Prediction Analysis is a web-based machine learning application designed to perform advanced text prediction and analysis. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the project provides insights into textual data, enabling users to explore predictive models interactively. Built with Python, Flask, and modern ML libraries, it showcases scalable deployment and real-time prediction capabilities. This project was developed as part of my MCA coursework to demonstrate expertise in machine learning, web development, and API integration.
Key features:

Real-time text prediction using state-of-the-art NLP models.
User-friendly web interface for input and visualization.
Scalable deployment on cloud platforms like Render.
Integration with environment variables for secure API key management.

Tech Stack

Backend: Python 3.11, Flask
Machine Learning: OpenAI API (or Hugging Face Transformers, depending on configuration)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Deployment: Render
Dependencies: python-dotenv, gunicorn, numpy, pandas (see requirements.txt)

Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/prediction-analysis.git
cd prediction-analysis


Create a Virtual Environment:
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Set Up Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the project root.
Add necessary API keys (e.g., for OpenAI):OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
PORT=8000




Run the Application:
python app.py


Access the app at http://localhost:8000 in your browser.



Usage

Launch the App:

Start the server locally or deploy it on Render.
Open the web interface in a browser.


Input Data:

Enter text or upload a dataset (depending on configuration) via the web interface.
The app processes the input using the trained ML model.


View Predictions:

Explore real-time predictions, probabilities, or visualizations (e.g., heatmaps for word predictions).
Results are displayed interactively on the webpage.


Example:

Input: "The quick brown fox"
Output: Predicted next word (e.g., "jumps") with confidence scores.



Deployment on Render
To deploy the project on Render:

Push to GitHub:

Ensure your repository includes requirements.txt, app.py, and a Procfile:web: gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:app




Create a Render Service:

Log in to Render.
Create a new web service, linking your GitHub repository.
Set the environment to Python and configure:
Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt
Start Command: gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:app
Python Version: 3.11 (or match your local version)




Add Environment Variables:

In the Render dashboard, add keys like OPENAI_API_KEY under the "Environment" section.


Deploy:

Trigger a deployment and monitor logs for errors.
Access the app at the provided Render URL (e.g., https://your-app.onrender.com).
